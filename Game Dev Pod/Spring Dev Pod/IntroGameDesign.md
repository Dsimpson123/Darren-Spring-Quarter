In your own words, define what a game is. 
In my opionion a game is playable app. I believe games are interactive apps
What is Game Design? 
The creative and systematic process of shaping the rules, systems, mechanics, and challenges.


What is the MDA framework? What are its parts? Define each.
MDA parts are Mechanics, Aesthetics, and Dynamics.Mechanics is the core rules, systems, &  actions  players can take in-game. Aesthetics are the way a game feels to a player.Dynamics  is the  gameplay that emerges from players interacting with a game’s mechanics.

Use the MDA framework to analyze your modified game. Write down your game then fill out these sections:

Mechanics - What rule/mechanic did your modify in your game? 
Instead og going to 21, we went to 25 in BlackJack, the face cats were any numbers we wanted to choose.

Dynamics - How does the gameplay of your modded game differ from that original version?
If you get all face cards, its easier to get to 21

How much does your modification change how the game feels to plays? What emotions change in players between both versions?

It seems unfair when your opponent gets a face card and you don't/
